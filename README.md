## About the Game

This Pong game is a recreation of the classic arcade game where two players control paddles on opposite sides of the screen, attempting to bounce a ball past each other to score points. The game continues until one player reaches a certain score threshold.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive gameplay.
- Responsive paddle controls using keyboard inputs.
- Dynamic paddle size adjustments based on player performance.
- Real-time scoring display for both players.
- Ball movement and collision mechanics.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python and the Pygame library installed (you can install Pygame using `pip install pygame`).
3. Run the `pong_game.py` script to start the game.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Akthar99/Pong-Game.git

# Controls
Player 1 (Left Paddle):

Move Up: W key

# Scoring

Each time the ball passes the opponent's paddle and goes out of bounds, the opposing player gains a point.
The first player to reach 3 points wins the game.
